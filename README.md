# Password Generator
## Overview
This application enables the user to generate a password from 1 to 99 characters, and copies it to clipboard. 
- It may include uppercase, lowercase letters as well as a collection of symbols/special characters.
- It ensures that an integer is submitted for the length of the password, otherwise it returns a warning message.
- The user can exit by using the exit button.
The tool utilizes the TkInter GUI to interface with the user, and pyperclip to copy the password to the clipboard automatically.
